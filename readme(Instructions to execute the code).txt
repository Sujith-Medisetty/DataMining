# DataMining
# Instructions to execute the code.

- please use google colab to execute the code... because this model will not run on CPU and need a good processing power from GPU.

-sign-in to your google colab account -upload DM_Final_Project.ipynb in google colab (click on File -- upload Notebook)

-sign-in to your google drive -upload news_summary.csv into contentdriveMyDriveColab Notebooks folder

-Change runtime of google colab -(goto runtime -- change runtime type -- choose GPU and save it)

-Now start allocating the resources (memeory, Processor) and run all cells.

-It will take around 30 minutes to train the model... So Execution of all cells may take around 35 minutes.

-finally we can see the summarised text by displaying the model_summary variable where text is the input Long paragraph and model_summary is the summarised text.
